We show that once a set of commitments have been extracted from a t-h pair , the task of recognizing textual entailment is reduced to the identification of the commitments from a t which support the inference of the h. Our system correctly identified entailment relationships in more than 80 % of t-h pairs taken from all three of the previous PASCAL RTE Challenges , without the need for additional sources of training data .
